# 🔌 Switch Panel

&#x20;

**Switch Panel** is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that lets you visually model and label your home's circuit breaker panel. Save your work by generating a QR code that securely stores your panel’s configuration. Scan the QR code later to instantly recreate your customized panel view.
